# SOAirDropShare
Before the release of iOS 7, every Apple device user had to rely on some third-party apps for sharing data and file between Apple devices.

However, Apple has introduced a new feature called Airdrop with the release of iOS 7 that allows users to share transfer data from mac to mac. Additionally, you can add this feature in your iOS app as well.
